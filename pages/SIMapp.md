# SIM Applacations

SIM applacations run on the SIM cards in your phone, in fact what we normally call SIM cards 
are actually a [Smart Card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_card) running an applacation to
interact with the cell network.

We Created our SIM app with Oracle's [Java Card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Card) one of the smallest
java implmantations, it runs on the Smart Cards. Due to the highly secure nature of SIM cards we want to
extend our SIM app to enable secure storing of Etherium privite keys and other information in the 
secure enclave of the SIM card.
